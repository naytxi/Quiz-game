# QUIZ GAME

A little quiz game.


## About
This project is a simple quiz game that consists of 10 multiple-choice questions fetched from a public trivia API. The game challenges the user to answer all questions correctly, tracking their score and displaying the results at the end. It's a fun and lightweight application built to demonstrate API usage, basic interactivity, and data visualization with charts.
